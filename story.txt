   the shepherd ,seeing that his flock was safe and happy had fallen asleeo  under the spreading branches of a large old tree
   
   suddenly an eagle swopped down from the sky .i tpounched on a little lamp and carried it off so swiftly that none of the other lambs even had the time to bleat. 
   The sleeping Shepherd heard nothing.
   
   A Crow was sitting on the tree under which the Shepherd lay asleep. 
   He had seen how the Eagle had caught the lamb and carried it off to his nest.
